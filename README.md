# Database Queries

## Topics

- Relational Databases
- Writing Basic SQL Queries
- Writing Basic Queries using Knex.js

## Assignment

For this lab you will:

- write SQL statements against a pre-populated database using an online tool. Once you have the correct SQL Statement for each query, write it inside the `queries.md` file under the appropriate heading.
- write database helper methods in `data/db-helpers.js` to interact with the `accounts` table
- create an express server and write API endpoints to manage the `accounts` resource

### Write Basic Queries

Visit [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top) using the **Google Chrome (or Chromium if you use Linux) browser** and write _SQL queries_ for the following requirements:

- find all customers that live in London. Returns 6 records.
- find all customers with postal code 1010. Returns 3 customers.
- find the phone number for the supplier with the id 11. Should be (010) 9984510.
- list orders descending by the order date. The order with date 1997-02-12 should be at the top.
- find all customers that include the word "market" in the name. Should return 4 records.
- add a customer record for _"The Shire"_, the contact name is _"Bilbo Baggins"_ the address is _"1 Hobbit-Hole"_ in _"Bag End"_, postal code _"111"_ and the country is _"Middle Earth"_.
- update _Bilbo Baggins_ record so that the postal code changes to _"11122"_.
- delete all customers that have no orders. Should delete 18 records.

**Clicking the `Restore Database` button in the page will repopulate the database with the original data and discard all changes you have made**.

### Write Database Helpers

Write the following helper methods in `data/db-helpers.js` to interact with the `accounts` table. Within this file, you have access to the `db` object, which will allow you to write `Knex.js` queries. 

-`find`
-`findById`
-`add`
-`update`
-`remove`

##### Accounts Schema

| field | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id    | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| name  | string           | required, unique |
| budget| numeric          | required         |

### Create a Server and API  

- Create an express server 
- Write CRUD endpoints for the `accounts` resource. Use your `db helpers` for database access. 
- Manually test your endpoints with `Postman` to check they are working as expected.

## Stretch Problems

The following exercises require research, the concepts needed to complete them have not been covered in class yet.

- find all suppliers who have names longer than 20 characters. You can use `length(SupplierName)` to get the length of the name. Returns 11 records.
- list customers names and the number of orders per customer. Sort the list by number of orders in descending order. _Ernst Handel_ should be at the top with 10 orders followed by _QUICK-Stop_, _Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery_ and _Wartian Herkku_ with 7 orders each.
- list orders grouped by customer's city showing number of orders per city. Returns 58 Records with _Aachen_ showing 2 orders and _Albuquerque_ showing 7 orders.
